# Roomies

Roomies is a web application that allows users to create groups or 'households', which multiple roommates may join. Roommates can schedule multiple chores based on day of week or every x amount of days. Each chore will automatically update to reflect whose turn it is. 

Roomies also feaures a visitor page that let's roommates schedule visitors with dates of arrival/leave dates, displaying how many nights they intend to stay.

There is also an items page that allows roommates to keep track of purchases made for the household, and will calculate a summary of all of the items purchased and split the total evenly among the number of roommates. 

This application was built using HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)/jQuery/AJAX for the front end and PHP and MySQL for the backend. I also implemented a Cron Job script that will allow roommates to be notified via SMS when it is their chore date, when a visitor is arriving, and when the item's bill is tallied up at the beginning of each month.
